    // Summary
    // Create a rock-paper-scissor game where the computer randomly choose a move
    // and the player chooses one. The prompt for the player can accept any case
    // The game checks to see which move is the winning one
    // and prints a message of the outcome
    // The game can also play more than one round

    // Plan
    // Interface is prompt
    // Input is the move from the player and it can accept in case
    // Internal input in form of computers random move
    // The output is the outcome of a round

    // Psuedocode
    // Computer randomly chooses rock, paper or scissors
    //    return choice
    // Play a single round using 2 parameters to determine round outcome
    //    compare player and computer moves
    //    return the outcome
    //    (function is case-insensitve)
    // Call playRound to play multiple rounds
    //    loop 5 times for 5 rounds
    //    keeps wins
    //    reports outcome of round
    // Use prompt to get players move
